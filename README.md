# Smart-Waste-Classifation
Project for Computational intelligence and Deep Learning, AIDE course at University of Pisa. We constructed multiple 
models from the ground up, varying their complexity. We utilized various techniques, such as depthwise separable 
convolution, residual modules, and inception modules. Additionally, we tested three different pretrained
models: MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2, and VGG16.
